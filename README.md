This is the readme file for the webscraping program.

Purpose:
The purpose of this program is to help a user narrow down their choices when selecting an organization to join. 
Since there are a large amount of clubs and organizations at OSU it's beneficial to the user to be able to
narrow down their results to make decisions easier. The campus, status, purpose statement, primary leader, 
and primary leader contact information (email) are printed to the console and optionally emailed.

Overview:
The user is presented a list of clubs after entering text to search for. The user then decides how many clubs
from the presented list they would like randomly selected and presented to them. Once the number of organizations
is selected the user will be asked if they would like to receive an email of the options chosen for them. If the 
user responds positively they are asked to enter the email they would like to use. The program then sends the user 
a list of organizations, along with pertinent info, they might be interested in.
